# Lazy Rails Setup

A small script for saving time when setting up a Linux environment for Rails in one go. Written to save myself some seconds of my 'invaluable' time.

## How to use
- Get the script
- Run the script

## Reminder
- `chmod +x ./setup.sh`
- `./setup.sh`

This will install Ruby 3 and Rails 7 by default as of this README. In case `rvm use <version-number>` does not work, it should notify you what's up.
