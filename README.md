# Lazy Rails Setup

A small script for saving time when setting up a Linux environment for Rails

## How to use
- Clone repo
- `cd lazy_rails_setup`
- `chmod +x ./setup.sh`
- `./setup.sh`

This will install Ruby 3 and Rails 7 by default as of this README. In case `rvm use <version-number>` does not work, it should notify you what's up but in case you're still confused, read the note below.

## Note
Be sure to enable 'Run command as a login shell' for your terminal emulator
